## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```shell
node: ">=20.17.1"
pnpm: ">=9.0.0"
```

### Development Setup

```shell
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/luxeCMS/luxe.git
cd luxe
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Lint and format code
pnpm check
```

### Testing Your Changes

1. Run tests:

```shell
# Run all tests
pnpm test
```

## Making Changes

### Branch & Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/my-bug
   ```

2. Make your changes and test thoroughly:

   ```shell
   pnpm build              # Build all packages
   pnpm test               # Run all tests
   pnpm check              # Check code style
   ```

3. Document your changes with a changeset:

   ```shell
   pnpm changeset
   ```

   The changeset CLI will guide you through:

   - Selecting which packages have changed
   - Choosing the type of version bump for each package:
     - `major` - Breaking changes
     - `minor` - New features
     - `patch` - Bug fixes
   - Writing a description of your changes

   Guidelines for good changeset messages:

   - Describe the change from a user's perspective
   - Mention any breaking changes clearly
   - Reference relevant issues/PRs with #
   - Keep it clear and concise

   Example changeset messages:

   ```
   Added new `useTheme` hook for accessing theme values

   Fixes #123
   ```

   ```
   BREAKING CHANGE: Removed deprecated `oldFunction` API

   Use `newFunction` instead. See #456 for migration guide.
   ```

4. Commit your changes following conventional commits:

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(ui): add useTheme hook"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix(core): resolve memory leak in worker pool"
   ```

5. Push to your fork and create a pull request:
   ```shell
   git push origin feat/my-feature
   ```

### Release Process

When creating your pull request, you can control the release process using labels:

- `release:stable` - Production release (npm tag: `latest`)

  - Use for stable features and bug fixes
  - Appears in main changelog
  - Creates a standard GitHub release

- `release:beta` - Beta release (npm tag: `beta`)

  - Use for feature-complete but untested changes
  - Marked as pre-release on GitHub
  - Won't appear in stable changelog

- `release:alpha` - Alpha release (npm tag: `alpha`)

  - Use for work-in-progress features
  - Marked as pre-release on GitHub
  - May contain breaking changes

- `release:preview` - Preview release (npm tag: `preview`)
  - Use for experimental features
  - Marked as pre-release on GitHub
  - May be unstable

**Release workflow**:

1. Add the appropriate release label to your PR
2. Once merged to `main`, the GitHub Action will:
   - Build all packages
   - Create new versions based on changesets
   - Publish to npm with appropriate tags
   - Create GitHub releases
   - Update package changelogs

### Tips for Good Pull Requests

1. **Package Selection**: When creating a changeset, carefully select only the packages that have actually changed.

2. **Version Bumping**:

   - `major`: Breaking changes that require user code modifications
   - `minor`: New features that are backward compatible
   - `patch`: Bug fixes and minor changes

3. **Change Description**:

   - Write from the user's perspective
   - Include migration steps for breaking changes
   - Reference related issues/PRs
   - Consider including code examples for API changes

4. **Testing**:

   - Add/update tests for new features
   - Verify all tests pass: `pnpm test`
   - Check style and formatting: `pnpm check`
   - Ensure builds succeed: `pnpm build`

5. **Documentation**:

   - Update relevant package README files
   - Add JSDoc comments for new APIs
   - Update any affected examples

6. **Changelogs**: The changeset becomes your changelog entry, so make it informative and user-focused.
   Example:

   ````
   Added new `useTheme` hook that provides type-safe access to theme values.

   ```tsx
   const theme = useTheme()
   const primary = theme.colors.primary
   ```

   Breaking Changes:

   - Removed support for legacy theme format
   - Theme object structure has changed

   Fixes #789
