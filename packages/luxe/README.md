## Overview

LuxeCMS is a modular headless CMS that lets you build your content infrastructure like a composable frontend. Each content module is independent, type-safe, and API-first, allowing you to create, extend, and maintain content architectures that scale with your needs. Plugins extend the core functionality of each module, providing a flexible and extensible platform for building content-driven applications.

- **Truly Composable**: Build your content infrastructure using independent, interconnected modules
- **API-first & Headless**: GraphQL and REST endpoints with full TypeScript support
- **Extensible Core**: Add custom modules and extend existing ones with plugins
- **Developer Experience**: Built with TypeScript and modern development practices

This project would not be possible without inspiration from [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/).

## Quick Start
