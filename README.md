## Overview

LuxeCMS is a modular headless CMS that revolutionizes content management through true composability and framework independence. Built for modern development workflows, it enables teams to create scalable content architectures that grow with their needs while maintaining complete control over their technology choices. Amazing, right?

## Key Features

- **True Composability**: Build your CMS like a composable frontend - add only what you need
- **Framework Independence**: No vendor lock-in - use any frontend framework or build your own integration
- **Live Preview**: Instantly preview content changes through external SSR renderers specific to your frontend
- **Content Types**: Documents, objects, widgets, pages, media, and more - all with full versioning and history
- **Developer-First**: Type-safe APIs, comprehensive docs, and an extensible plugin system
- **Plugins**: Extend LuxeCMS with custom plugins for your specific use case (e.g. e-commerce, SEO, etc.)

## Quick Start
